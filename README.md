# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is to help me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. To do this I coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help me understand how each one works. I also included information on what Git is and some of the ways to use it. This is also a good way to utilize what I learn and as well as refresh what I have learned. So far in this project I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git but there is so so so much to learn / understand.
